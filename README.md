# KlotskiProjectUniPd
Final Project for Software Engineering course at UniPD

# Documentation
Documentation available at Doc folder

# Notes
No jar file available. In order to play the game download the repository and open the main file with an IDE like eclipse.

The solver can only solve the original default configuration creating a "Soluzioni.txt" file where it shows every move. If the user move a piece in another way the solver can't solve the puzzle anymore.

The txt files must stay out of src folder when the repository is downloaded and the jar file has to be added like a library in the IDE used to launch the program.
